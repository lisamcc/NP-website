<h2>National Parks I've Visited</h2>
<ul>
<li> Sequoia National Park <img src="sequoiatree.jpg"></li>
<p>This National Park is famous for its massive Sequoia Trees. We were able to hike through forests of these trees and even drive our car through one of them. Along our hike, we were even able to see a bear! We also stopped to see General Sherman, the largest lving tree in the world. For more information, visit the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/seki/index.htm">National Park's Website on Sequoia.</a></p>
<li> Joshua Tree National Park<img src="joshuatree.jpg">
<p> Joshua Tree is located in the desert in southern California. While I was there, we walked around huge rock formations and vast expanses of sand and Joshua trees. For more information, visit the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/jotr/index.htm">National Park's Website on Joshua Tree.</a></p>
<li> Yosemite National Park  <img src="yosemite.jpg">
<p> When I visited Yosemite, I saw amazing views of waterfalls, evergreen trees, rock formations, and mountains. The rocky hikes we did took us through forests and past waterfalls and open meadows. The views from the top were breathtaking. For more information, visit the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm">National Park's Website on Yosemite.</a> </p>
<li> Zion National Park <img src="zionvalley.jpg"><img src="zioncastle.jpg"></li>
<p>Zion is located in Utha and is famous for its amazing with colorful, rocky cliffs and breathtaking views. Flash floods occur frequently, so hiking through the narrows can be dangerous. For more information, visit the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/zion/index.htm">National Park's Website on Zion.</a></p>
<li> Grand Canyon National Park <img src="grandcanyon.jpg"></li>
<p> The Grand Canyon is very grand! I didn't realize how amazing the views actually are. Pictures don't do it justice after you have ben there in person. Sunsets and Sunrises over the colorful canyon are breathtaking and the size and depth of the canyon is magnificent. For more information, visit the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm">National Park's Website on the Grand Canyon.</a> </p>
<li> Bryce Canyon National Park <img src="brycecanyon.jpg"><img src="brycecanyongoat.jpg"></li>
<p> This National Park is also so amazing. Orange sand has created thousands of amazing formations among the cliffs and mountains of Utah. The shapes and creations that erosion has left makes the landscape breathtaing from a high viewing point.  For more information, visit the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/brca/index.htm">National Park's Website on Bryce Canyon</a></p>
<li> Great Smoky Mountains National Park <img src="greatsmokymountains.jpg"></li>
<p> This National Park covers a huge expanse of mountains and meadows in the East. In my visits there I've been able to go on hikes overlooking mountain ridges, seen a herd of elk, toured historical properties at the top of mountians, and seen amazing waterfalls. The plants, landscapes, and wildlife to see is beatiful. For more information, visit the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/index.htm">National Park's Website on the Great Smoky Mountians</a> </p>
